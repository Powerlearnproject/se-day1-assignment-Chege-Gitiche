Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline of writing instructions on computers and maintaining these instructions which make our lives much easier. Its importance is that through software engineering we are able to solve real-world problems in an efficient and structured way

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The birth of software engineering (1950-1960). This was marked by the creation of the first high-level programming language. Previously codes were written in machine code and/or assembly language
2. Overcoming the software crisis (1965-1985). This was a time in history whereby, challenges in software engineering were becoming more and more notable. For example, projects would frequently exceed their allocated budget and time frame which in turn caused harm to people and companies.
3. The quest for the perfect solution (1985-Present). This is the time in history whereby, there was a quest for finding the ultimate solution to all the problems in software engineering. Though an individual by the name Fred Brooks challenged this notion and suggested that there is no perfect or singular solution that will bring about a massive change in productivity and overtime the community recognized improvement only comes from incremental efforts


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement analysis- This is the first stage of SDLC which entails gathering and defining software requirements
2. Planning - this is the stage whereby estimation of cost, time and resources is done
3. Design - This is the stage whereby a system structure is created, UI/UX designs are made and the architecture of the system is decided
4. Coding - This is the stage whereby the designs are implemented and written down in the form of code
5. Testing - This is the stage whereby identification and fixing of bugs is done
6. Deployment - This is the stage whereby the software is released to the end users
7. Maintenance - This is the stage whereby the software is updated and improved over time


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall 
-It is sequential in nature
-It is difficult to implement changes
-Testing is performed at the end
-It is suitable for large projects with clear requirements for example a banking or hospital system

Agile
-It is iterative and flexible in nature
-It is easy to incorporate changes
-Testing is performed continuously throughout
-It is suitable for dynamic projects with evolving requirements for example, a social-media applications

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
1. Writes, tests and maintains code
2. Collaborate with designers and engineers to implement new features in a project

Quality Assurance Engineer
1. Conducts manual and automated testing to find bugs in the code
2. Ensures that software meets quality standards

Project manager
1. Oversees the project's completion from the start to the end
2. Coordinates communication between different branches of the team and the stakeholders

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE's assist developer write and debug codes efficiently by providing them with a list of tools they can use to streamline their coding experience. Examples are like VS code, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA

VCS is a tool that helps track code changes, coordinate collaboration between multiple developers and maintain a version history, Examples include Git and SVN

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Fixing bugs- This can be overcome by using techniques such as peer to peer reviews and automated testing
2. Collaboration - This can be resolved by using communication tools like slack, notion and Jira
3. Managing Complexity - This can be overcome by breaking the code into smaller components called modules


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - This tests individual components in a program
2. Integration testing  - This ensures that multiple modules work together correctly
3. System testing - This tests the entire system to ensure it meets the requirements
4. Acceptance testing - This checks whether the software meets the business requirements before deployment


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering the practice of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models to provide accurate and relevant responses.Its importance is that ensures that AI provide useful answers and reduces ambiguity 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt is  "Tell me facts about the ocean" and an example of an improved prompt will be "Tell me facts about the coral reefs found near beaches in the ocean"
The improved prompt is more effective as it tries to nail on a specific topic of interest allowing the AI model to search more keenly and efficiently about that singular topic as opposed to a large topic such as the ocean
